      Software engineering has always fascinated me. It covers all levels of
      complexity that satisfies my hunger for knowledge. The true challenge
      comes not only from the technology side but also from understanding
      business needs. I am proficient in design (
      <code> UI, UX, architecture </code>), develop, test, and scale software
      (web &amp; native) applications and/or systems.

      I went to data science &amp; AI area as a Doctor of Philosophy student
      (with full-ride scholarship) by researching
      <code> meta-learning &amp; recommender systems </code> topics at Monash
      University. Now, I am a teaching associate for software engineering units
      at the Faculty of IT, Monash University. I love connecting with all of my
      students aside from just delivering content. At the same time, I am
      working on various software projects with{' '}
      <code> ReactJS, Quantlib, NodeJS, Gatsby, and Django frameworks </code>.
