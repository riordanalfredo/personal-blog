## Introduction

In the team, you as the leader always wants to get things done. It is not just simply tell people what do they need to do. It will not develop their true potential in the team. Without utilising their potential, meaning you put your own mind into a team's work, you cannot gain benefits from working as a team.

According to John C. Maxwell, in the book **'How Successful People Lead'**, He found best methods to help others do their jobs well. It is called five-step equipping process. These steps are referenced from Chapter: Best Behaviours on Level 4 'How to Develop People'. These steps explanation are solely based on my thoughts & opinion:

### Step 1 - I do it (competence)

This is the first step where you try to show them what you are capable to do. It is pretty easy and straightforward, that you take part of the things that need to be done. However, it feels like competition and might feel you put your ego at the first place. Don't get it wrong! you are helping your team in taking down things to-do. Before you lead, or move to the next step (demonstration), you must understand it first at its best.

### Step 2- I do it and you are with me (demonstration)

After you able to do things alone, it is time to step up your game. Demonstration is good way help you understand more into something. While you're demonstrating, you let them get into your world. Unconsciously, you give them knowledge that is raised at the same level as yours. Keep your communication open as they will not understand if you do it quietly.

### Step 3- You do it and I am with you (coaching)

This step is slightly harder, as you give them some trust to do things. They might not meet your expectation and it might let you down. This is where your patience as leader will be tested. People make mistakes. Let them know where did they get it wrong, and let them experience and study it. Always keep in mind that as the great leader, you are the captain of your crews. Grow up your trust towards them and you are ready for the next step.

### Step 4 - You do it (empowerment)

As you cannot always be side-by-side with your team, you might want to give your 100% trust to them. By giving your trust, you build their confidence. Confidence is the key for your success, their success, and the team's success. They might feel that they're well-trusted and keep it at constant pace. Well, I'm afraid to say that you might not be able to proceed to the next step. Even though you trust and empower them, you still need to guide them at back.

### Step 5- You do it and someone is with you (reproduction)

This is the hardest part, where you build leadership skills inside people you taught before. This trust is not to get things done effectively, but towards get things done efficiently. It grows your team's productivity, because you are not spending time to teach others over and over again. In good case, where one of your team able to reach step 5, your team's productivity will grow exponentially.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, these steps are continuous, meaning you can use any steps below steps 5 even after you have reach Step 5. This steps are not only improving team's productivity, but also relationships within your team. What's your thought about these steps?

This short article is referenced from 'How Successful People Lead' by John C. Maxwell. It is an amazing book that broaden up your view towards people you lead. Grow your leadership skills beyond!
