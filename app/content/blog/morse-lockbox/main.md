# Hello

Hello readers! Have you ever imagined that applying a traditional encoding telecommunication method could actually open an alternative in the real-world application of security system? Does it sound interesting to you?

Let me introduce the **Internet of Things (IoT) prototype: Morse Code Lockbox**

## TL DR; An IoT prototype that applies morse code as an alternative to security system with `Arduino and Web application (ReactJS)`

I'm so excited to share one of my projects that I did during my study in university. This project / assignment encouraged us to innovate and create an artifact that demonstrate our learning of emergent technologies. I highly recommend this [unit / subject](https://www3.monash.edu/pubs/2019handbooks/units/FIT3146.html) for those who are eligible in my university!

Here, I will try my best to present it to all kind of readers (non-tech to tech-savvies). Without further ado, let's get it on!

> If you have any questions, ideas, or feedbacks; Please leave me a comment below! I would love to improve this project anytime in the future. You may access my code [here](https://github.com/riordanalfredo/morse-lockbox)

## 1. Motivations

- There are many types of locks
- Latest type: biometric and iris
- Several potentials

---

## 2. Background and Theory

### Morse code

- Definition

### How does it work

---

## 3. Materials and Codes

### Box (Arduino)

- Nice

### The key (web app)

---

## 4. Future works

### Wifi module or RaspberryPi

- Explain what I had tried with this implementation, even though I failed it.

### Speed-up the visible light reading sensors

- Improve the sensor (instead of prototype)

## 5. ACK (acknowledgements) and References

- My fellas and teaching team in that unit, very insightful!
- Thanks to unit ENG1003, where I got the idea from my first year assignment.
- Since I did not have enough time to conduct proper literature review (the project was done in parallel with ), here are some references that I found after the assessment
- If you are happy and found this post is interesting enough, please share and.
