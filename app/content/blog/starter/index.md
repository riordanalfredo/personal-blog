# Dear readers,

Hello, and welcome to my space! First of all, I want to say thank you for visiting this humble journal/blog :). This space is like a diary to express my thoughts, ideas, and other random stuffs about my journey to be one of the technology lead in ICT. First of all, let me introduce myself :)

My name is **Riordan**, people usually call me Rio (yep, like that bird, or a city in Brazil, ha!). As I am writing this article, I am in Melbourne, Australia. I am a teaching associate at Faculty of IT, Monash University, and I teach software engineering units. I am also working on a software development project, while studying Management in parallel.

I came from a small city in Indonesia, Malang (if you understand Bahasa Indonesia / Malay, it means `poor`, `unfortunate`, or `hapless`). Despite its unique name, it is a great city! Warm-hearted people, nice scenery, and foremost, the food! The food is very delicious, tasty, and cheap! Wow, I miss them so much...

Uhm, I think the introduction might have gone too far. Anyway, you can read more about me in [here](https://rioalfredo.com/about-me). So, let's talk more about this blog.

# Technopreneur

This blog covers the combination of `business`, `ICT-software`, and `learning` domain. I believe those topics are mandatory and well understood to be a successful `technopreneur`. So, what is the meaning of this word?

The main purpose of this blog is to compile and publicly share these knowledge, so that you and I can learn how to be one of them. To be honest, I am still learning and I will keep learning about it, even from you, my reader :)!

Furthermore, I also love to discuss about `pseudoscience` topics, especially about psychology. It includes western and chinese astrology, 16 personalities test, enneagram, and other psychology tests. I mainly apply them to have a better communication and understanding about people around me, not for fortune telling.

# 5 reasons to start this blog

Now, here are my top 5 reasons (without order) why do I start this blog.

## 1. Owning a digital asset

- I was convinced that Blog is another form of current digital currency.
- Most people use other platforms like YouTube, Instagram, etc.
- They are great places to start because easy to set up, matured, and can gain exposure.
- However, these platforms are not entirely owned by them as their accounts belongs to those organisations.
- hopefully, I can make leads and opportunities to monetise as the side income

## 2. Grow my personal brand

- Validate my expertise: this blog, my past and current projects, software engineering knowledge, and etc.
- Networking by building rapport and engagement
- Stand out

## 3. Improve my communication skills (writing)

- Organise and thoughts and learn
- Exercise my freedom of speech

## 4. Learn together with like-minded people

- Transition from business to IT and the other way around
- Help people to learn about programming and software engineering knowledge better.
- Open discussion about leadership and management in business
-

## 5. Practice discipline

- Sun Tzu said about iron discipline.
- Setting up schedule to write and publish

> Hopefully, this blog can facilitate the discussion and achieve your desires!
